# SQL for the Akkeri database

This directory contains the SQL needed to alter the database structure relative
to the initial schema defined in `.../initial_schema/`.

The files herein should have the extension `*.sql` and have a file name
starting with the ISO date when the file was created. This ensures that they
are applied in order.
